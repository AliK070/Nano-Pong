# Nano-Pong

## A bit about the project:
I decided to get some OLED screens from a vendor, to test them out I used an Arduino Nano paired up
with this oled screen and two buttons. The toughest part about this project is really just the code itself, understanding how the ball travles and how it colides with the walls was a bit tough.
